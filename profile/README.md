# Welcome to OpenSiFli at GitHub

SiFli Technologies is a fabless semiconductor design company specializing in silicon platforms tailored for modern AIoT applications. These platforms are typically battery-powered and need to deliver either high-performance computing, ultra-low power consumption, or, frequently, both simultaneously.

SiFli’s SF32 series of microcontrollers feature microprocessors that operate at a peak frequency of 240MHz while ensuring minimal leakage current in sleep mode. The integrated I$ and D$ caches enable seamless execution from extended memory like PSRAM and NOR Flash. The series also provide a range of SiP (system-in-package) options, with in-package PSRAM capacities reaching up to 64MB.

All SiFli microcontrollers come standard with an in-house developed 2.5D GPU, providing hardware-accelerated graphics processing for tasks such as alpha blending, rotation, scaling, and more. An independent display controller manages data transfer to displays with various interfaces, including SPI (1/2/4 data lanes), 8080, DPI/RGB, MIPI, JDI, and others.

Low-power wireless connectivity is provided via single-mode BLE or dual-mode BT/BLE, offering industry-leading ultra-low power consumption. For instance, maintaining a BLE connection with a 1-second interval requires as little as 6µA, while keeping a BT sniff mode (1-attempt) with a 1-second interval requires less than 10uA.
